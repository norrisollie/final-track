# Track - Version 2

## What is it?
Track is a small web application I designed and developed for my Final Major Project. I decided to continue on Track for my final major project, as I wanted to improve my knowledge of coding languages, such as HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript. Unlike version 1, it allows users to specify a station that they'd like to look up, as opposed to just being able to see the stations closest to their location.

Currently the API used to find the closest stations is no longer working, however I am working on finding an alternative.
